# Micro-Polling-Site

In this project, I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front end. And I have used MySQL, php and AJAX for the backend. AJAX is used for dynamically updating the data in the backend.

It is a project I did back in 2023 for academic purposes and also for my own, as I am very passionate about web development.
